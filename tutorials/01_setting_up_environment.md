# Setting Up Your Development Environment

Welcome to the first step in your CDH (Command and Data Handling) journey!  
Before you can start coding for our Small Sats, you'll need to set up a development environment that lets you write, build, and test C++ code efficiently — and eventually interact with real hardware like the BeagleBone Black.

## 1. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

If you’re on Windows, you’ll need **WSL** to get a proper Linux environment (which is what we use for development).  
We recommend installing **Ubuntu** as your Linux distribution.

You can find installation instructions and information on Ubunutu and many other Linux distributions on [Linux Journey](https://labex.io/linuxjourney)

Once WSL is installed and setup according to Linux Journey, open it and make sure it says something like:

Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS (GNU/Linux 6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2 x86_64)
your_user:~$
